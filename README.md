# 🏋️ Gym Management System  

A modern gym management platform built with **Payload CMS** and **Bun**. It’s still under construction, but the goal is to make managing workouts, trainers, and memberships way smoother — and eventually ship it as a **PWA** so people can use it like a native app.  

> ⚙️ still in dev mode — backend’s getting there, frontend + PWA bits next up.
